#L4D2-Logger

A tool that logs some basic info for stat tracking of competitive L4D2 games

##Objective

Tracking different stats about maps and configs used for competitive L4D2 games.  The goal is to see which maps are the most played as well as which maps are easier or harder to survive.

Depending on the size of the logs I will try to make them publicly available from bonerbox.  If they get too large too quickly I'll look into creating some scripts that track some basic information (average survivors for each map, total games played on each map, etc).

##Current Features

Currently the plugin only tracks very basic information.  Map name, config name and the number of survivors at the end of the round.  Possible additions in the future:
* Distance for each survivor
* Health for each survivor
* Damage taken by each survivor
* Boss spawn percentage
* Time taken for each round
